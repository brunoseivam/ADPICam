PICAM is a C++ library provided by Teledyne Princeton Instruments, 
a business unit of Teledyne Digital Imaging, US.

This library provides a common API to drive a number of 
cameras from Teledyne Princeton Instruments.  This library is freely available, 
downloadable, and redistributable.  We have included header and library files
here for version 5.13.3.2211 as a convenience for building the EPICS areaDetector
driver.

on their website and would prefer users to install directly from their site.
